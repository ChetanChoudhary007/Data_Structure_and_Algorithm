## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a variety of DSA problems, including popular coding interview questions, algorithm challenges, and more. Each problem includes:

- A clear problem statement.
- Sample input and output.
- One or more solutions in various programming languages.

Feel free to explore the problems, attempt them on your own, and compare your solutions with the provided ones. This repository is a valuable resource for anyone preparing for technical interviews, competitive programming, or simply looking to strengthen their DSA skills.

## Problem List

Below is a list of DSA problems available in this repository:

1. Problem 1: [countBits](countBits)
   - Description: Given an integer n, return an array of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.
   - Difficulty: Easy.
   - Tags: `Array`
   - [Solution:1](https://github.com/ChetanChoudhary007/Data_Structure_and_Algorithm/blob/main/Arary_Easy/countBits.py)

2. Problem 2: [NextPermutation](NextPermutation)
   - Description: A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Tags: `Array`
   - [Solution:2](https://github.com/ChetanChoudhary007/Data_Structure_and_Algorithm/blob/main/Array_medium/next_permutation.py)

3. Problem 3: [RevreseInteger](reverseInteger)
   - Description: Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then       return 0.
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Tags: `Array`
   - [Solution:3](https://github.com/ChetanChoudhary007/Data_Structure_and_Algorithm/blob/main/Array_medium/reverse_number.py)
     
4. Problem 4: [MaximumSubarray](maximumSubarray)
   - Description: Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Tags: `Array`,`Kadane's Algorithm`
   - [Solution:4](https://github.com/ChetanChoudhary007/Data_Structure_and_Algorithm/blob/main/Array_medium/maximum_subarray.py)

5. Problem 5: [SuperiorElements](superiorElements)
   - Description: Given an array, print all the elements which are leaders. A Leader is an element that is greater than all of the elements on its right side in the array
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Tags: `Array`,`Basic`
   - [Solution:5](https://github.com/ChetanChoudhary007/Data_Structure_and_Algorithm/blob/main/Arary_Easy/Superior_elements.py)
