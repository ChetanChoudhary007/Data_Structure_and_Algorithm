## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a variety of DSA problems, including popular coding interview questions, algorithm challenges, and more. Each problem includes:

- A clear problem statement.
- Sample input and output.
- One or more solutions in various programming languages.

Feel free to explore the problems, attempt them on your own, and compare your solutions with the provided ones. This repository is a valuable resource for anyone preparing for technical interviews, competitive programming, or simply looking to strengthen their DSA skills.

## Problem List

Below is a list of DSA problems available in this repository:

1. Problem 1: [countBits](countBits)
   - Description: Given an integer n, return an array of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.
   - Difficulty: Easy.
   - Tags: `Array`, `binary represtation`
   - [Solution 1](https://github.com/ChetanChoudhary007/Data_Structure_and_Algorithm/blob/main/Arary_Easy/countBits.py)

2. Problem 2: [NextPermutation](NextPermutation)
   - Description: A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Tags: `Array`
   - [Solution 2](https://github.com/ChetanChoudhary007/Data_Structure_and_Algorithm/blob/main/Array_medium/next_permutation.py)
     
<!-- Add more problems as needed -->

## Solutions

You can find solutions to the problems in this repository organized by programming language:

- [Python](python/) [for now only in this particular language]
- [Java](java/)
- [C++](cpp/)

Each language directory contains solutions to the problems in that language. Feel free to contribute your own solutions or improve existing ones.
